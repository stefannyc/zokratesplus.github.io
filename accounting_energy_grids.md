title: Accounting in Energy Grids
description: Trade Energy Locally
---

*   **Context:** Households acting as energy prosumers can benefit by organizing themselves in a community and trade energy among community member.
*   **Potential:** Thanks to ZoKrates, confidential information required for [accounting](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg308/publications/2020/preprint-ICBC-Eberhard.pdf), e.g., smart meter measurements, can be used on the blockchain without being revealed to other community members.
*   **Technology:** The application of ZoKrates for privacy-preserving accounting in energy grids has been validated in a larger research project in form of prototypes and [field experiments](https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/decentralized-energy-trading).
