title: Transaction Aggregation
description: Reducing cost and enabling privacy
---


*   **Context:** Rollups enable verifiable off-chain aggregation of token transaction, thereby, reducing transactional costs and enabling privacy.
*   **Potential:** Through ZoKrates, the transaction aggregation can be executed as a zkSNARK that is verifiable by a dedicated Rollup smart contract.
*   **Technology:** ZoKrates represents the core of [Polygon Nightfall](https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-nightfall/), a novel rollup protocol [developed by EY](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_3) and Polygon that is now live.
