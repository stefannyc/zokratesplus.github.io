## ZoKrates
ZoKrates allows you to extend your DApp through privacy-preserving and scalable off-chain computations without compromising key properties of blockchains. Thereby, you can reduces transaction costs and balance between privacy and transparency. 

## ZoKratesPlus
ZoKratesPlus is a publicly funded project that brings ZoKrates to practice by exploring application contexts, growing the ZoKrates community, and advancing Zokrates-based technologies. 


## Application Contexts

# Transaction Aggregation
Rollups enable verifiable off-chain aggregation of token transaction, thereby, reducing transactional costs and enabling privacy.
Through ZoKrates, the transaction aggregation can be executed as a zkSNARK that is verifiable by a dedicated Rollup smart contract.
ZoKrates represents the core of Polygon Nightfall, a novel rollup protocol developed by EY and Polygon that is now live.

# Anonymous Credentials
Anonymous credentials enable the verification of identity-related information without revealing confidential information to the verifier.
ZoKrates not only enables ACs verification by DApps but also to verify novel aspects of ACs more cost efficienctly, thereby, improving the state-of-the-art.

A credential system has been designed and implemented in compliance with the W3C recommandations for verifiable credentials.

# Accounting in Energy Grids
Households acting as energy prosumers can benefit by organizing themselves in a community and trade energy among community member.
Through Zokrates, confidential information required for accounting, e.g., smart meter measurements, can be used on the blockchain without being revealed to other community members.

The application of ZoKrates for privacy-preserving accounting in energy grids has been validated in a larger research project in form of prototypes and field experiments.

# Federated Learning
Blockchains improve security guarantees of federated learning by making the global model management more transparent and tamper-resistant.
Through ZoKrates, also the local training executed by edge devices becomes verifiable on the blockchain, thereby, extending gained properties to the who learning process.

A system design and proof of concept implementation demonstrates technical feasibility and reveals initial insights regarding the systemâ€™s performance and applicability.
