# ZoKratesPlus
ZoKratesPlus is a publicly funded project for exploring new application contexts, nurturing the zero knowledge community, and advancing zero knowledge based technologies.

# Technology: ZoKrates
ZoKrates allows you to extend your DApp through privacy-preserving and scalable off-chain computations without compromising key properties of blockchains. Thereby, you can reduces transaction costs and balance between privacy and transparency. 

# Application Contexts

### Transaction Aggregation

*   **Context:** Rollups enable verifiable off-chain aggregation of token transaction, thereby, reducing transactional costs and enabling privacy.
*   **Potential:** Through ZoKrates, the transaction aggregation can be executed as a zkSNARK that is verifiable by a dedicated Rollup smart contract.
*   **Technology:** ZoKrates represents the core of [Polygon Nightfall](https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-nightfall/), a novel rollup protocol [developed by EY](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_3) and Polygon that is now live.


### Anonymous Credentials

*   **Context:** Anonymous credentials enable the verification of identity-related information without revealing confidential information to the verifier.
*   **Potential:** ZoKrates enables the [verification of anonymous credentials (ACs) by DApps](https://github.com/JonathanHeiss/ZoKrates-Credential-Verification) more cost efficienctly, thereby, [improving on the state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09584.pdf).
*   **Technology:** A credential system has been designed and implemented in compliance with the [W3C recommandations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) for verifiable credentials.


### Accounting in Energy Grids

*   **Context:** Households acting as energy prosumers can benefit by organizing themselves in a community and trade energy among community member.
*   **Potential:** Thanks to ZoKrates, confidential information required for [accounting](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg308/publications/2020/preprint-ICBC-Eberhard.pdf), e.g., smart meter measurements, can be used on the blockchain without being revealed to other community members.
*   **Technology:** The application of ZoKrates for privacy-preserving accounting in energy grids has been validated in a larger research project in form of prototypes and [field experiments](https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/decentralized-energy-trading). 


### Federated Learning

*   **Context:** Blockchains improve security guarantees of [federated learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11641.pdf) by making the global model management more transparent and tamper-resistant.
*   **Potential:** Through ZoKrates, also the local training executed by edge devices becomes verifiable on the blockchain, thereby, extending gained properties to the who learning process.
*   **Technology:** A system design and [proof of concept](https://github.com/NikolasHaimerl/Advancing-Blockchain-Based-Federated-Learning-Through-Verifiable-Off-Chain-Computations) implementation demonstrates technical feasibility and reveals initial insights regarding the systemâ€™s performance and applicability. 


Currently, we are trying to identify projects that would benefit most from our support. Feel free to [reach out](./contact.html) and share your practical zero knowledge experience or needs.
