title: Federated Learning
description: Tamper resistant decentralized model management
---

*   **Context:** Blockchains improve security guarantees of [federated learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11641.pdf) by making the global model management more transparent and tamper-resistant.
*   **Potential:** Through ZoKrates, also the local training executed by edge devices becomes verifiable on the blockchain, thereby, extending gained properties to the who learning process.
*   **Technology:** A system design and [proof of concept](https://github.com/NikolasHaimerl/Advancing-Blockchain-Based-Federated-Learning-Through-Verifiable-Off-Chain-Computations) implementation demonstrates technical feasibility and reveals initial insights regarding the systemâ€™s performance and applicability.
